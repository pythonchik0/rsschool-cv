3. I am currently in my 2nd year of college. I believe that the college program will not provide the necessary skills to get a job and I am not interested in the field that we are taught, so I decided to study at the RS School at the same time. My goal is that I want to develop in the Front-end direction and, depending on the value of my skills, get a job in a company.
Programmed in Python solving simple logic problems. I have basic Git skills.

        elif n[i] == ' ':
            n[i+1] = chr(ord(n[i+1])-32)
    return n
